# Contributing to Autoprefixer
Please feel free to contribute to Autoprefixer by submitting Pull Requests to add new features, ehancements, bug fixes, etc. If you're not sure whether a PR should be created for something, [open an issue](https://github.com/postcssAautoprefixer/issues) to ask about it first. Check the specific section depending on the type of contribution you want to make.

Once your PR is accepted it will incorporated into the next main release of Autoprefixer.

**Important**: Autoprefixer works by leveraging data from [caniuse](https://caniuse.com/). Therefore it's important that support for a particular CSS feature is available there before we can enable support for it here. You can check the listing of features that need to be added [here](https://caniuse.com/issue-list).

## Getting started
Before you begin contributing make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free).
* [Fork the repository](https://github.com/postcssAautoprefixer)
* Clone a copy of it to your computer: `git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/autoprefixer`
* Ensure that you have the [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager installed
* run `yarn install` this will install all dependencies needed to run tests
* File an issue, see [filing issues](#filing-issues)
* Once issue is discussed and accepted, you can begin making the necessary changes

## Adding a prefix
We'll explain how would you go about adding a CSS feature to Autoprefixer. For example, we'll add support for a CSS feature called `background-clip: text`

Note: Remember that the feature that you want to add must also be supported on [caniuse](https://caniuse).

* Create a topic branch from the `master` branch. Like this: `git checkout -b add/background-clip-text`
tip: use 'add', 'fix' or 'enhancement' to indicate on your type of contribution

* To add support for a CSS feature you must call the convert function inside of `data/prefixes.js` and specify three parameters: data, options and a callback. Like this:
  ```
  f(require('caniuse-lite/data/features/background-clip-text'), browsers =>
    prefix(['background-clip'], {
      feature: 'background-clip-text',
      browsers
    })
  )
  ```
* In order to add support for a new feature we need to add a hack to the `libs/hacks` folder using the name of the CSS feature as the filename. Tip: 'hack' is the actual support for the new feature.

* Create a class that extends `Value`. In his new class change the prefix for `IE` to `-webkit-`. [See complete example](https://github.com/postcss/Autoprefixer/blob/73c7b6ab090a9a9a03869b3099096af00be7eb7d/lib/hacks/background-clip.js)

* Load the new class in `lib/prefixes.js`. We refer to a new added class as a 'hack'. To load it we use `Declaration` module and call the `hack` method on the new class we created earlier. Like this:
  ```
  Declaration.hack(require('./hacks/background-clip'))
  ```
  g[See detailed example](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer/blob/73c7b6ab090a9a9a03869b3099096af00be7eb7d/lib/prefixes.js)

* Add unit tests to:
  - `test/autoprefixer.test.js` to test that Autoprefixer works with Chrome and Edge browsers adds only -webkit- prefix. [See details here](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer/commit/73c7b6ab090a9a9a03869b3099096af00be7eb7d)
  - `test/cases/background-clip.css` TODO: Explain how to add unit test to the CSS
  - Run yarn test
  - Push branch with updated commits to your copy of the fork
  - Create and send PR to Autoprefixer


## Changing an existing prefix
TODO

## Fixing Bugs
1. Create
2. Add test (same as above)
3. You can send PR. The issue with tests if better than issue just with text
4. But if you fix it, it will be always better
5. yarn test
6. Send PR

## Filing issues
Issues, questions, or comments about existing features should be filed as an issue. Support for new features also requires filing a new issue. You can file an issue [here](https://github.com/postcssAautoprefixer/issues).

- If you have problems with the output CSS from Autoprefixer; you'll need to post:

  1. Input CSS
  2. Output CSS
  3. Expected output CSS
  4. Run `npm ls | grep autoprefixer` and check output
  5. Browserslist config. If you use `browsers` option, create Browserslist config first.

- If Autoprefixer throws error:

  1. Input CSS
  2. Run `npm ls | grep autoprefixer` and check output
  3. Run `npm ls | grep postcss` and check output
  4. Browserslist config
  5. Error stacktrace (with example for users who donâ€™t know what is stacktrace)

## Running Tests
Autoprefixer needs units test to verify that a given prefix will work as expected. Depending on the type of change being made you'll need to add...
For tests, you need to add `test/cases/PROP.css` with input and `test/cases/PROP.out.css`. Where `PROP` is the name of the feature you're adding support for.

If you need specific browsers for the test, add Autoprefixer instance [here](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer/blob/master/test/autoprefixer.test.js#L69). Then add test [here](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer/blob/master/test/autoprefixer.test.js#L424) 

## Creating a hack
TODO

## Guidelines and tips
* Make logical, meaningful and brief commits
* Push changes to your local feature branch first, Like this: `git push origin fix/background-image`
* Submit a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) with the description of the feature/fix/enhancement that you want to propose
